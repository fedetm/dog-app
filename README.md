# dog-app
Using Swift, write an app that calls this endpoint: https://dog.ceo/api/breed/pug/images/random/20 and display the results in a feed. Please use a UICollectionView for the data container. 

Requirements: 
1. When the user reaches the end of the grid, call the API again to load more items, and the new items are added to the list (infinite scroll).
2. Implement the “Like” Counter and Heart Button. The actual number can be random, but it must be consistent (if I see 3 likes on an image and I scroll down, and I scroll back up it should be the same number). Pressing “Heart” increments the count and highlights the button.

Bonus points are awarded on app responsiveness, performance, and whatever optimizations you can make for real-world use.
Use any libraries/tools you need as you see fit. Please justify their use. Organize the project like you would a real app and use best practices for the organization. Code structure/style counts, not just “Does the end product work?”
